An Abstract Data Type (ADT) defines a logical view of data and the operations that can be performed on it, without specifying the underlying implementation details. While there isn't a single "complete" and universally agreed-upon list, as new ADTs can be conceptualized, here are some of the most common and fundamental ADTs:
Linear ADTs:
List: An ordered collection of elements, allowing insertion, deletion, and access at specific positions.
Stack: A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structure, supporting push (add) and pop (remove) operations.
Queue: A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) structure, supporting enqueue (add) and dequeue (remove) operations.
Deque (Double-ended Queue): A queue that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends.
Priority Queue: A queue where elements are retrieved based on their priority.
Non-Linear ADTs:
Set:
A collection of unique, unordered elements.
Multiset (Bag):
A collection of elements where duplicates are allowed and order is not significant.
Map (Associative Array, Dictionary):
A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value.
Multimap:
Similar to a map, but allows multiple values to be associated with a single key.
Tree:
A hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes.
Binary Tree: A tree where each node has at most two children.
Binary Search Tree: A binary tree where the left child's value is less than the parent's, and the right child's value is greater.
Heap: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property (e.g., min-heap or max-heap).
Graph:
A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them, representing relationships.
Other Notable ADTs:
String: A sequence of characters.
Container/Collection: A general ADT representing a group of elements, often serving as a supertype for other ADTs.
