A data structure is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer so it can be used efficiently. It's a fundamental concept in computer science, providing a systematic approach to handling information. Different data structures are suited for different tasks, impacting how quickly and easily data can be accessed, modified, or processed.  

Key aspects of data structures:
* Organization: Data structures define how data elements are related to each other and how they are arranged in memory. 
* Storage: They provide a method for storing data in a way that optimizes for specific operations. 
* Manipulation: Data structures offer operations (like adding, deleting, searching) that can be performed on the stored data. 
* Efficiency: Choosing the right data structure can significantly improve the performance of algorithms and applications.

Why are data structures important?
* Performance: They enable faster data access and manipulation, leading to more efficient programs. 
* Organization: They help structure complex data in a logical and manageable way. 
* Problem-solving: They provide tools for solving various computational problems efficiently. 
* Algorithm design: Data structures are often closely tied to the algorithms used to process the data. 

## Taxonomy of Data Structures
Data structures can be classified in various ways, but a common and fundamental taxonomy categorizes them into two main types:

#### Primitive Data Structures:
These are the most basic data types directly supported by programming languages and typically represent single values.
* Integers: Whole numbers (e.g., int, long).
* Floats/Doubles: Numbers with decimal points (e.g., float, double).
* Characters: Single letters or symbols (e.g., char).
* Booleans: True/false values (e.g., bool).
* Pointers: Variables that store memory addresses.

#### Non-Primitive Data Structures:
These are more complex structures derived from primitive data structures and are used to store collections of data items, often with specific relationships between them. Non-primitive data structures are further classified based on their organization:
* Linear Data Structures: Elements are arranged sequentially, with each element connected to its predecessor and successor (except the first and last).
* Arrays: A collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations, accessed by an index.
* Linked Lists: A collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node.
* Stacks: A Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) structure where elements are added and removed from one end (the "top").
* Queues: A First-In, First-Out (FIFO) structure where elements are added at one end (the "rear") and removed from the other (the "front").
* Non-Linear Data Structures: Elements are not arranged sequentially and represent hierarchical or network-like relationships.
* Trees: Hierarchical structures where elements are organized in a parent-child relationship (e.g., Binary Trees, AVL Trees, B-Trees).
Graphs: Collections of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect them, representing relationships between entities (e.g., Directed Graphs, Undirected Graphs).
Hash Tables: Structures that map keys to values using a hash function for efficient data retrieval.
Heaps: Tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property (e.g., Min-Heap, Max-Heap).
