# GCC - the Essentials

## What is the GCC?

GCC stands for “GNU Compiler Collection”. GCC is an integrated distribution of compilers for several major programming languages. These languages currently include C, C++,
Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, Ada, D, Go, and BRIG (HSAIL).  

> *When we talk about compiling one of those languages, we might refer to that compiler by its own name, or as GCC. Either is correct.*

The language-independent component of GCC includes the majority of the optimizers, as well as the *“back ends”* that generate machine code for various processors.  The part of a compiler that is specific to a particular language is called the *“front end”*. For example the C front-end is called CC, the C++ compiler is G++, the Ada compiler is GNAT, and so on.  

Historically, compilers for many languages, including C++ and Fortran, have been implemented as “preprocessors” which emit another high level language such as C. None of
the compilers included in GCC are implemented this way; they all generate machine code directly.

#### C Standards supported by GCC

GCC supports all C standards starting ANSI C Standard in 1990 upto more recent C2X standard, which has mostly experimental support. GCC also provides some extensions to the C language - GNU Extensions that, on rare occasions conflict with the C standard. Use of the ‘-std’ options listed below disables these extensions where they conflict with the C standard version selected.

|  C Standard |  Language option  | GNU Extension |
|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|
| ANSI or C90 | -ansi or -std=c90 |  -std=gnu90   |
|     C99     |      -std=c99     |  -std=gnu99   |
|     C11     |      -std=c11     |  -std=gnu03   |
|     C17     |      -std=c17     |  -std=gnu17   |
|     C2X     |      -std=c2x     |  -std=gnu2x   |

> *The default, if no C language dialect options are given, is ‘-std=gnu17’.*

#### C++ Standards supported by GCC

GCC supports the original ISO C++ standard published in 1998, and the 2011, 2014, 2017 and mostly 2020 revisions. By default, GCC also provides some additional extensions to the C++ language that on rare occasions conflict with the C++ standard. Use of the ‘-std’ options listed below disables these extensions where they they conflict with the C++ standard version selected.

|        C++ Standard       |   Language option   | GNU Extension |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------:|---------------|
| ISO C++ Standard or C++98 | -ansi or -std=c++98 | -std=gnu++98  |
|           C++03           |      -std=c++03     | -std=gnu++03  |
|           C++11           |      -std=c++11     | -std=gnu++11  |
|           C++14           |      -std=c++14     | -std=gnu++14  |
|           C++17           |      -std=c++17     | -std=gnu++17  |
|           C++20           |      -std=c++20     | -std=gnu++20  |

> *The default, if no C language dialect options are given, is ‘-std=gnu++17’.*


 ## Compiling with GCC

After you edit your source code with a text-editor, the next step is to to compile your program using GCC.  When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking.


```Shell
g++ -std=<std> -o <executable> <src1.cpp> [src2.cpp ...]              # to compile witha specific version of C++
```

In order to debug an executable, it must be compiled with –g flag to save the symbol table. The symbol table contains the list of memory addresses corresponding to the variables and various machine instructions.

```Shell
gcc -Wall –g -o <executable_name>  <source files>
gcc –Wall –Og –o <executable_name> <source files>
gcc –Wall –std=C++17 –Og –o <executable_name> <source files>
```

Run the program as follows:

```Shell
./<executable>
```

## A Summary of GCC Command Options

Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are useful for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language (usually C++), the explanation says
so explicitly.

The gcc program accepts options and file names as operands.

You can mix options and other arguments. For the most part, the order you use doesn’t matter.

Order does matter when you use several options of the same kind.

Some options take one or more arguments typically separated either by a space or by the equals sign (‘=’) from the option name.

#### Overall Options
Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation proper, assembly and linking, always in that order. The “overall options” allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. GCC is capable of preprocessing and compiling several files either into several assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable file. 

-c Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link. The ultimate output is in the form of an object file for each source
file. By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix
‘.c’, ‘.i’, ‘.s’, etc., with ‘.o’. Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are ignored.

-S Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble. The output is in
the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input file specified.
By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by replacing the
suffix ‘.c’, ‘.i’, etc., with ‘.s’.
Input files that don’t require compilation are ignored.

-E Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper. The output
is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the standard output.
Input files that don’t require preprocessing are ignored.
-o file Place the primary output in file file. This applies to whatever sort of output is
being produced, whether it be an executable file, an object file, an assembler
file or preprocessed C code.

If ‘-o’ is not specified, the default is to put an executable file in ‘a.out’, the
object file for ‘source.suffix’ in ‘source.o’, its assembler file in ‘source.s’, a
precompiled header file in ‘source.suffix.gch’, and all preprocessed C source
on standard output.

* C/C++ language Options

-std= Determine the language standard


* Warning Options

Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that are not inherently erroneous
but that are risky or suggest there may have been an error.

-w Inhibit all warning messages.
-Werror Make all warnings into errors.
-Werror= Make the specified warning into an error. The specifier for a warning is
appended; for example ‘-Werror=switch’ turns the warnings controlled by
‘-Wswitch’ into errors.

-Wall This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider
questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning),
even in conjunction with macros. This also enables some language-specific
warnings

-Wextra This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by ‘-Wall’.
The option ‘-Wextra’ also prints warning messages for the following cases:
 A pointer is compared against integer zero with <, <=, >, or >=.
 (C++ only) An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a conditional
expression.
 (C++ only) Ambiguous virtual bases.
 (C++ only) Subscripting an array that has been declared register.
 (C++ only) Taking the address of a variable that has been declared
register.
 (C++ only) A base class is not initialized in the copy constructor of a derived
class.

* Debugging Options

To tell GCC to emit extra information for use by a debugger, in almost all cases you need
only to add ‘-g’ to your other options.
GCC allows you to use ‘-g’ with ‘-O’. The shortcuts taken by optimized code may
occasionally be surprising: some variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of control
may briefly move where you did not expect it; some statements may not be executed because
they compute constant results or their values are already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops. Nevertheless it
is possible to debug optimized output. This makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for
programs that might have bugs.
If you are not using some other optimization option, consider using ‘-Og’


With no ‘-O’ option at all, some compiler passes
that collect information useful for debugging do not run at all, so that ‘-Og’ may result in
a better debugging experience.
-g Produce debugging information in the operating system’s native format (stabs,
COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF). GDB can work with this debugging information.
On most systems that use stabs format, ‘-g’ enables use of extra debugging
information that only GDB can use; this extra information makes debugging
work better in GDB but probably makes other debuggers crash or refuse to read
the program.

-ggdb Produce debugging information for use by GDB. This means to use the most
expressive format available (DWARF, stabs, or the native format if neither of
those are supported), including GDB extensions if at all possible.
gdwarf
-gdwarf-version
Produce debugging information in DWARF format (

-glevel
-ggdblevel

Request debugging information and also use level to specify how much information.
The default level is 2.
Level 0 produces no debug information at all. Thus, ‘-g0’ negates ‘-g’.
Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in parts
of the program that you don’t plan to debug. This includes descriptions of
functions and external variables, and line number tables, but no information
about local variables.
Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions present in
the program. Some debuggers support macro expansion when you use ‘-g3’.
If you use multiple ‘-g’ options, with or without level numbers, the last such
option is the one that is effective.

* Optimization Options

These options control various sorts of optimizations.
Without any optimization option, the compiler’s goal is to reduce the cost of compilation
and to make debugging produce the expected results

Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance
and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and possibly the ability to debug the
program.

Most optimizations are completely disabled at ‘-O0’ or if an ‘-O’ level is not set on the
command line, even if individual optimization flags are specified. Similarly, ‘-Og’ suppresses
many optimization passes.

-O
-O1 Optimize. Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot more
memory for a large function.

-O2 Optimize even more. GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations that do
not involve a space-speed tradeoff. As compared to ‘-O’, this option increases
both compilation time and the performance of the generated code

-O3 Optimize yet more. ‘-O3’ turns on all optimizations specified by ‘-O2’ and also
turns on the following optimization flags:

-O0 Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected results.
This is the default.

-Og Optimize debugging experience. ‘-Og’ should be the optimization level of choice
for the standard edit-compile-debug cycle, offering a reasonable level of optimization
while maintaining fast compilation and a good debugging experience

## Common File Formats

## Difference in behaviour - cc vs g++
When you compile C++ programs, you should invoke GCC as g++ instead.

C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes ‘.C’, ‘.cc’, ‘.cpp’, ‘.CPP’, ‘.c++’,
‘.cp’, or ‘.cxx’; C++ header files often use ‘.hh’, ‘.hpp’, ‘.H’, or (for shared template code)
‘.tcc’; and preprocessed C++ files use the suffix ‘.ii’. GCC recognizes files with these
names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you call the compiler the same way as
for compiling C programs (usually with the name gcc).

However, the use of gcc does not add the C++ library. g++ is a program that calls GCC
and automatically specifies linking against the C++ library. It treats ‘.c’, ‘.h’ and ‘.i’ files
as C++ source files instead of C source files unless ‘-x’ is used. This program is also useful
when precompiling a C header file with a ‘.h’ extension for use in C++ compilations. On
many systems, g++ is also installed with the name c++.
