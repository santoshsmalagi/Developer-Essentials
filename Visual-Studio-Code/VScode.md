## VS Code Extensions
VS Code Extensions allow developers to extend the capability of VS Code by adding languages, debuggers, and tools to support several development workflows. VS Code's rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS Code. VS Code extensions can be installed directly using the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode).
