# Basics of Tcl

```Tcl
puts "Hello World!"

# defining variables in Tcl
set val 100
puts "The value is $val";

# combining two commands on same line with a semicolon character
> set a 99; set b 100;

# use expr to calulate arithmetic expressions
set a 900
set b [expr $a + $val]

# increment b by 1
incr b
puts "b = $b"

# unset variables
unset a
puts "The value of a = $a"    # cant read a, no such variable

# Returns 1 if the variable named varName exists in the current context 
info exists a   # returns 0
set a 1
info exists a   # returns 1
```

## Comments

Single line comments in Tcl begin with a #

```Tcl
# This is a comment
set a 100
set b 99;  # This is also a comment
```

Multi-line comments - enlcose a block of code within an ``if`` command with ``false`` condition

```Tcl
if 0 {
  while {$val > 0} {
    puts "x = $x"
    incr x -1
  }
}
```

## exec 

The ``exec`` command executes a system command/binary from Linux/Unix while staying within the tclsh. The ``exec`` command treats its arguments as the names and arguments for a set of programs to run. Any external EDA software binary can also be executed from within the shell of EDA tool using the exec command.

```Tcl
# simple use of exec
set output [exec helloworld.tcl]
puts output

# exec to run Linux/other commands
set output [exec pwd]
puts $output

set output [exec whoami]
puts $output

set output [exec which tclsh]
puts $output
```
## eval

Tcl allows users to define new commands, which can later be executed using the ``eval`` command.

```Tcl
# define a short-hand notation of cmd
set cmd { puts "Hello World!" }
eval $cmd
set output [exec which tclsh]
puts $output

# a more involved example
set i 0
set increment {incr i}
set cmd {
    while { $i < 20 } {
        puts "i = $i"
        eval $increment
    }
}
eval $cmd
```
