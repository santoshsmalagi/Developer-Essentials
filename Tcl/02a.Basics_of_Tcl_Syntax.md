# Basics of Tcl

```Tcl
puts "Hello World!"

# defining variables in Tcl
set val 100
puts "The value is $val";

# use expr to calulate arithmetic expressions
set a 900
set b [expr $a + $val]

# increment b by 1
incr b
puts "b = $b"

# unset variables
unset a
puts "The value of a = $a"    # cant read a, no such variable
```

## Comments

Single line comments in Tcl begin with a #

```Tcl
# This is a comment
set a 100
set b 99;  # This is also a comment
```

Multi-line comments - enlcose a block of code within an ``if`` command with ``false`` condition

```Tcl
if 0 {
  while {$val > 0} {
    puts "x = $x"
    incr x -1
  }
}
```
