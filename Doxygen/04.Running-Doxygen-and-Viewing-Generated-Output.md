## Running Doxygen and Viewing Generated Output

```Shell
doxygen <config-file>
```

Depending on your settings doxygen will create html, rtf, latex, xml, man, and/or docbook directories inside the output directory.he default output directory is the directory in which doxygen is started. The root directory to which the output is written can be changed using the OUTPUT_DIRECTORY. The format specific directory within the output directory can be selected using the HTML_OUTPUT, RTF_OUTPUT, LATEX_OUTPUT, XML_OUTPUT, MAN_OUTPUT, and DOCBOOK_OUTPUT. tags of the configuration file.
 
#### HTML output
The generated HTML documentation can be viewed by pointing a HTML browser to the index.html file in the html directory.
