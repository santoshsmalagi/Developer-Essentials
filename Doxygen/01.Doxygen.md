# Doxygen

Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C/C++ sources. Since the documentation is extracted directly from the source, it is much easier to keep the documentation in sync with the source code. Doxygen offers the following capabilities:

* generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (e.g. LaTeX, man pages) from a set of documented source files
* quickly extract code structure from undocumented source files, which is useful for navigating large code bases
* visualize relationships between between various elements by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, collaboration diagrams etc. 

``doxygen`` - the executable ``doxygen`` is the main program that parses the sources and generates documentation  
``doxywizard`` - is a graphical front-end for editing the configuration file which is used by ``doxygen`` and for running ``doxygen`` in a graphical environment

Working with Doxygen basically involves three steps:

* Step I - annotate source code with *special comments* or *special comment blocks*
* Step II - create a configuration file by running ``doxygen -g <name-doxygen-config-file>``, which generates a config file ``(default - Doxfile)``. Modify settings as required.
* Step III - run ``doxygen <Doxyfile>`` to parse the source code and generate documentation in html and LaTeX formats.
