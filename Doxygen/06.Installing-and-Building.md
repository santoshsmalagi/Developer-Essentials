# Installing and Building

The following briefly describe the process of installing and building Doxygen and it's dependencies on CentOS and Ubuntu.

## CentOS 7

#### Step I - update to the latest version of gcc

```Shell
# update the system
sudo yum -y update

# install dependencies (if not available already)
sudo yum -y install bzip2 wget gcc gcc-c++ gmp-devel mpfr-devel libmpc-devel make   

# download gcc source from nearest mirror
wget http://mirror.rit.edu/gnu/gcc/gcc-9.3.0/gcc-9.3.0.tar.gz 

# untar
tar -xvzf gcc-9.3.0.tar.gz                                                                  

# create a build dir to avoid messing up source code dir
cd gcc-9.3.0
mkdir build                                                                                  
cd build

# configure gcc for build and install
../configure --enable-languages=c,c++ --disable-multilib

# default install at /usr/local
sudo make
sudo make install         

# add to path
export PATH=/usr/loca/bin:${PATH}           

# add to linker search dir path
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}                                   
```

#### Step II - build and install cmake

get the latest version of cmake src from - https://cmake.org/download/, after you untar:

```Shell
./bootstrap && make && make install
```

> *If you are unable to build cmake on CentOS, download binary packages and set $PATH accordingly*

#### Step III - build and install graphviz

get the latest version of graphviz from https://graphviz.org/download/source/, after you untar

```Shell
./configure
make
make install
```

add bin dir path to $PATH

#### Step IV - build and install doxygen

get the latest version of Doxygen from https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html, after you untar

```Shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
make
```

To force a fresh build after an earlier check-out simple remove the build directory and redo the steps above. After the binaries have been built, you can use

```Shell
make install
```

to install them. 

## Ubuntu
Install Doxygen on Ubuntu using the ``apt`` package manager:

```C++
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essentials                 # if you dont already have gcc installed
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install doxygen
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```
