## Annotating Source Code with Comment Blocks

Various entities in source code (e.g. classes and their member variables and methods, global functions, structs, variables, namespaces, macros and typedefs) need to be annotated with comments (or comment blocks). This can be done in two ways:

* Place a special comment block in front of the declaration or definition of the member, class or namespace. For file, class and namespace members it is also allowed to place the documentation directly after the member. See - [Special comment blocks](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html#specialblock).
* Place a special comment block somewhere else (another file or another location) and put a structural command in the documentation block. A structural command links a documentation block to a certain entity that can be documented (e.g. a member, class, namespace or file). See - [Documentation at other places](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html#structuralcommands) and [Special Commands](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html).

A special comment block is a C or C++ style comment block with some additional markings, so doxygen knows it is a piece of structured text that needs to end up in the generated documentation. 

For each entity in the code there are two (or in some cases three) types of descriptions, which together form the documentation for that entity; a brief description and detailed description, both are optional. For methods and functions there is also a third type of description, the so called in body description, which consists of the concatenation of all comment blocks found within the body of the method or function.  

A brief description is a short one-liner, whereas the detailed description provides longer, more detailed documentation. An "in body" description can also act as a detailed description or can describe a collection of implementation details. Having more than one brief or detailed description is allowed but not recommended.

Doxygen supports both C and C++ style comment blocks:

#### C-style comments

C style (or original JavaDoc style) comment blocks - a C-style comment block starting with two \*'s

```C
/**
 * ... text ...
 */
```

Qt style

```C
/*!
 * ... text ...
 */
```

the intermediate \*'s are optional, so

```C
/*!
 ... text ...
*/
```

is also valid. A more visible block style could be:

```C
 /************************************************
 *  ... text
 * It starts with a forward slash followed by some number n, 
 * of asterisks, where n > 2. It's written this way to be more "visible" 
 * to developers who are reading the source code.
 * requires JAVADOC_BLOCK = YES and JAVADOC_BANNER = YES
 * to be set in the config file
 ***********************************************/
 ```
 
 or

```C
/********************************************//**
 *  ... text
 * does not behave well with Clang compiler
 * notice the two //'s at the end of the first line
 ***********************************************/
 ```

#### C++ style

```C++
///
/// ... text ...
///
```

or

```C++
//!
//!... text ...
//!
```

a blank line ends a documentation block in this case. A more visible block style could be:

```C++
/////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// ... text ...
/////////////////////////////////////////////////
```

## Documenting members
To document the members of a file, struct, union, class, or enum, it is sometimes desired to place the documentation block after the member instead of before. For this purpose you have to put an additional ``<`` marker in the comment block. Note that this also works for the parameters of a function.  

```C
int var; /*!< Detailed description after the member */
int var; /**< Detailed description after the member */


int var; //!< Brief description after the member
int var; ///< Brief description after the member  

int var; //!< Detailed description after the member
         //!< 
int var; ///< Detailed description after the member
         ///< 
```

To document a member of a C++ class, you must also document the class itself. The same holds for namespaces. To document a global C function, typedef, enum or preprocessor definition you must first document the file that contains it (usually this will be a header file, because that file contains the information that is exported to other source files).

Documenting functions

```C
/**
* a normal member taking two arguments and returning an integer value.
* @param a an integer argument.
* @param s a constant character pointer.
* @see Javadoc_Test()
* @see ~Javadoc_Test()
* @see testMeToo()
* @see publicVar()
* @return The test results
*/
int testMe(int a,const char *s);
```

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/***********************************************************************
* @file: main.c
* Main control flow for the application
*
* This file contains the main() function which calls the functions
* to perform argument parsing, print a suitable message and error out
* in case of an error, and perform clean up tasks
*************************************************************************/

int main(int argc, conts char* argv[])
{

}

```
