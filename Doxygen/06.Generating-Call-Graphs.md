# Generating Call Graphs

Doxygen can leverage the use of ``dot`` tool from graphviz to generate call graphs. [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) is an open-source, cross-platform graph drawing toolkit.  

## Types of graphs generated by Doxygen
Doxygen can generate the following graphs:
* An include dependency graph for each documented file that includes at least one other file. 
* An inverse include dependency graph is also generated showing for a (header) file, which other files include it.
* A graph is drawn for each documented class and struct that shows:
  * A graphical representation of the class hierarchy
  * An inheritance graph for each documented class, showing the direct and indirect inheritance relations. 
  * the usage relations with other structs and classes (e.g. class A has a member variable m_a of type class B, then A has an arrow to B with m_a as label).
* if ``CALL_GRAPH`` is set to YES, a graphical call graph is drawn for each function showing the functions that the function directly or indirectly calls
* if ``CALLER_GRAPH`` is set to YES, a graphical caller graph is drawn for each function showing the functions that the function is directly or indirectly called by 

## Configuration
To enable the graphing features of Doxygen:
  * the ``dot`` tool must be included in ``$PATH`` and accessible
  * the path to ``dot`` can be manually configured via ``DOT_PATH`` in the Doxyfile
  * ``HAVE_DOT``, ``CALL_GRAPH`` and ``CALLER_GRAPH`` must be set to ``YES``
  * ``EXTRACT_ALL`` and/or ``EXTRACT_STATIC`` to ``YES`` may need to be set to enable graphing for ``static`` functions

Suggested Doxygen configuration for graphing:

```Shell
HAVE_DOT               = YES
EXTRACT_ALL            = YES
EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES
EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES
CALL_GRAPH             = YES
CALLER_GRAPH           = YES
DISABLE_INDEX          = YES 
GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES
RECURSIVE              = YES
```

To include or exclude a function from drawing it's caller graph sue the following structural commands in the function documentation:

```Shell
\callgraph
\callergraph
\hidecallgraph
\hidecallergraph
```

## Viewing call-graphs
Go to the html folder and open ``annotated.html`` to view generated call graphs. t is also possible to refer to the png images of the call graphs.
