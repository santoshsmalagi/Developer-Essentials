## Generating Call Graphs

Doxygen can use the "dot" tool from graphviz to generate more advanced diagrams and graphs. Graphviz is an open-source, cross-platform graph drawing toolkit and can be found at http://www.graphviz.org/.  

Doxygen uses the "dot" tool to generate the following graphs:
* A graphical representation of the class hierarchy will be drawn, along with the textual one. Currently this feature is supported for HTML only.
* An inheritance graph will be generated for each documented class showing the direct and indirect inheritance relations. This disables the generation of the built-in class inheritance diagrams.
* An include dependency graph is generated for each documented file that includes at least one other file. 
* An inverse include dependency graph is also generated showing for a (header) file, which other files include it.
* A graph is drawn for each documented class and struct that shows:
  * the inheritance relations with base classes.
  * the usage relations with other structs and classes (e.g. class A has a member variable m_a of type class B, then A has an arrow to B with m_a as label).
* if ``CALL_GRAPH`` is set to YES, a graphical call graph is drawn for each function showing the functions that the function directly or indirectly calls
* if ``CALLER_GRAPH`` is set to YES, a graphical caller graph is drawn for each function showing the functions that the function is directly or indirectly called by 

To enable the graphing features of Doxygen 
* you need to have the ``dot`` tool in ``$PATH``, if for some reason doxygen can't find ``dot``, you can manually set the path via ``DOT_PATH`` in your Doxyfile
* set ``HAVE_DOT```, ``CALL_GRAPH`` and ``CALLER_GRAPH`` to ``YES``
* might need to set ``EXTRACT_ALL`` and/or ``EXTRACT_STATIC`` to ``YES`` depending on the type of functions

Basically in the Doxyfile:

```Shell
HAVE_DOT               = YES
EXTRACT_ALL            = YES
EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES
EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES
CALL_GRAPH             = YES
CALLER_GRAPH           = YES
DISABLE_INDEX          = YES 
GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES
RECURSIVE              = YES
```

Go to the html folder and open ``annotated.html`` to view all details of your project. You will also view png images of the call graphs embedded in the html that are relevant (to some functions/classes for example).  

To include or exclude a function from drawing it's caller graph:

```Shell
\callgraph
\callergraph
\hidecallgraph
\hidecallergraph
```
