# Doxygen Template for C Programs
This is a collection of readily usable templates to generate documentation for C source code using the Doxygen system. Code documentation is absolutely vital to keep the codebase readable and to preserve valuable knowledge. While comments and code documentation are very important, the best code is self-documenting. When documenting code do it with the audience in mind - the next developer who will need to understand the code to fix bugs and ship enhancements. *Be generous â€” the next one may be you!*
