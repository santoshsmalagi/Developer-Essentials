# Doxygen

Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C/C++ sources while also supporting other languages. Since the documentation is extracted directly from the sources, it is much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code. Doxygen offers the following capabilities:

* generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (e.g. LaTeX, man pages) from a set of documented source files.
* quickly extract code structure from undocumented source files which is often useful in navigating large code bases
* visualize relationships between between various elements by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, collaboration diagrams etc.
