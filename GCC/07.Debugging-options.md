# 7. Debugging options

Normally, an executable file does not contain any references to the original program source code - such as variable names or line-numbers. This is insufficient for debugging since there is no easy way to find the cause of an error if the program crashes. GCC provides the ```-g``` debug option to store additional debugging information within object files and executables in the form of symbol tables.

These symbol tables allow errors to be traced back from a specific machine instruction to the corresponding line in the original source file. It also allows the execution of a program using a *symbolic debugger*, such as the GNU Debugger.

## Why debugging optimized code is not always efficient?
The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally be surprising - some variables declared may not exist at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it; some statements may not be executed because they compute constant results or their values are already computed; some statements may execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.

> *With GCC it is possible to use optimization in combination with the debugging option ``-g`` i.e. by using the ``-Og`` flag. Many other compilers do not allow this!*

## Commonly used debug options

#### ``-g``
* Produce debugging information in the operating system’s native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).
* On most systems that use the stabs format, ``-g`` enables use of extra debugging information that only GDB can use

#### ``-ggdb``
* Produce debugging information for use by GDB.
* This means to use the most expressive format available (DWARF, stabs, or the native format if neither of those are supported), including GDB extension if at all possible.

#### ```-gdwarf``` or ```-gdwarf-version```
Produce debugging information in DWARF format.

#### ```-glevel``` or ```-ggdblevel```
* Request debugging information and also use level to specify information. The default level is 2.
* Level 0 produces no debug information at all. Thus, ``-g0`` negates ``-g``.
* Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in parts of the program that you don’t plan to debug. This includes descriptions of functions and external variables, and line numbers, but no information about local variables.
* Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions present in the program. Some debuggers support macro expansion when you use ``-g3``.

#### ``-Og``
* Save debugging information for optimized code, may not offer full debug experience of ``-g``, but in most cases it should suffice.

> *If you use multiple ``-g`` options, with or without level numbers, the last such option is the one that is effective.*
