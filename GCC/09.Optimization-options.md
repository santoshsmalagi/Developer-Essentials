## 8. Optimization options

These options control various sorts of optimizations.
Without any optimization option, the compiler’s goal is to reduce the cost of compilation
and to make debugging produce the expected results

Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance
and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and possibly the ability to debug the
program.

Most optimizations are completely disabled at ‘-O0’ or if an ‘-O’ level is not set on the
command line, even if individual optimization flags are specified. Similarly, ‘-Og’ suppresses
many optimization passes.

-O
-O1 Optimize. Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot more
memory for a large function.

-O2 Optimize even more. GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations that do
not involve a space-speed tradeoff. As compared to ‘-O’, this option increases
both compilation time and the performance of the generated code

-O3 Optimize yet more. ‘-O3’ turns on all optimizations specified by ‘-O2’ and also
turns on the following optimization flags:

-O0 Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected results.
This is the default.

-Og Optimize debugging experience. ‘-Og’ should be the optimization level of choice
for the standard edit-compile-debug cycle, offering a reasonable level of optimization
while maintaining fast compilation and a good debugging experience
