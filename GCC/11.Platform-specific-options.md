## 11. Platform specific options

GCC provides a range of platform-specific options for different types of CPUs. These options control features such as hardware floating-point modes, and the use of special instructions for different CPUs. They can be selected with the ``-m`` option on the command line, and work with all the GCC language frontends, such as ``gcc`` and ``g++``.  

The following sections describe some of the options available for common platforms. A complete list of all platform-specific options can be found in the GCC Reference Manual. Support for new processors is added to GCC as they become available.

#### Commonly used platform specific flags

``-mtune=generic``                # tune executable for all generic archietctures
``-march=x86-64``                 # tune executable for x86-64
