## 11. Platform specific options

GCC provides platform-specific options for several processors and processor families. These options control features such as hardware floating-point modes, and the use of special instructions for the target CPU architecture. They can be selected with the ``-m`` option on the command line, and work with all the GCC language frontends, such as ``gcc`` and ``g++``. Support for new processors is added to GCC as they become available.

#### Commonly used platform specific flags

``-mtune=generic``                # tune executable for all generic archietctures  
``-march=x86-64``                 # tune executable for x86-64
