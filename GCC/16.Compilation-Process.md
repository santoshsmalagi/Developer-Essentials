# 16. Compilation Process

The process of converting source code into an executable is a multi-stage process involving several tools, including the GNU Compiler itself (through the ``gcc`` or ``g++`` frontends), the GNU Assembler ``as``, and the GNU Linker ``ld``. The complete set of tools used in the compilation process is referred to as a *toolchain*. It broadly consists of the following steps:

1. Code development
2. Pre-processing
3. Compilation proper (lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis)
4. Assembling
5. Linking
