# 16. Compilation Process

Deriving an executable from source code is a multi-step process and broadly consists of the following steps:

1. Code development using a text-editor
2. Pre-processing using the GNU Preporcessor (``cpp``) for macro expansion
3. Compilation proper (lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis) using the language front end (i.e. ``gcc`` or ``g++``) to convert source code from C/C++ to assembly
4. Assembling - using GNU Assembler (``as``) to convert assembly code to object files (machine code)
5. Linking - using the GNU Linker (``ld``) to resolve references and create the final executable

> *All steps are executed automatically and transparently by GCC internally.*
