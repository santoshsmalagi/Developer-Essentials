# 16. Compilation Process

> *Compilation - process of translating source code from a higher level language to a lower level language.*

Deriving an executable from source code using is a multi-step process, asusming *GNU Toolchain* is used, then this would basically convert to:

1. Code development using a text-editor (using Vim/Emacs etc.)
2. Pre-processing for macro expansion (GNU Preprocessor - ``cpp``)
3. Compilation proper - (1) source code parsing (2) tokenization (3) syntax, semantic analysis (4) conversion from C/C++ to assembly
4. Assembling - convert assembly code to machine code (object code) of the target CPU architecture (GNU Assembler ``as``)
5. Linking - resolve references/symbols to create the final executable (GNU Linker ``ld``)

> *All steps are executed internally by GCC, so unless there is a specific need there is no need to run each step individually.*

Each of these steps and how the source code is transformed is dissected step by step using the following example. Pre-processor macros are intentionally included to illustrate conditional compilation and preprocessor replacement of macro definitions with constant values. 

```helloWorld.h``` declares the function prototype for ```hello```.

```C
/**********************************************
helloWorld.h
***********************************************/

#ifndef HELLO_WORLD
#define HELLO_WORLD

#define TRUE 1
#define FALSE 0

#ifdef DEBUG
#define DEBUGPRINT(X) printf("%s",X);
#else
#define DEBUGPRINT(X)
#endif

void hello(const char *str);

#endif
```

```helloWorld.c``` defines the function ```hello```, which simply prints a string to the ```STDOUT```.

```C
/**********************************************
helloWorld.c
***********************************************/

#include <stdio.h>
#include "helloWorld.h"

void hello(const char *str)
{
  printf("%s",str);
  printf("\nTRUE is %d", TRUE);
  printf("\nFALSE is %d", FALSE);

  DEBUGPRINT("\nDEBUG WAS DEFINED DURING COMPILATION\n")
  
}

```

```main.c``` includes ```helloWorld.h``` and calls the function ```hello```.

```C
/**********************************************
main.c
***********************************************/

#include "helloWorld.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    hello("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## 1. Code Development
The first natural step in any software development project is to *write* code using a text editor or a suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice. When using the GNU toolchain for C/C++ programming the tools of the trade are the vim or GNU Emacs editors. The organization of the code into multiple source files and it's architecture vastly influences the compilation pipeline. Not to mention that good programming practices and secure coding result in a binary which is faster, smaller and secure.

> *It is a standard practice to use a build automation system such as GNU make to manage the compilation process.*

## 2. Pre-processing
The pre-processor ``cpp`` operates on pre-processor directives and performs the following operations:
* includes the contents of header files specified using ``#include`` directives
* replaces constants and macros defined using ``#define`` with their values - it performs no type checking, replaces text as is
* exclude or include lines of code based on ``#if``, ``#elif``, ``#ifdef``, and ``#ifndef`` statements

The C pre-processor ``(cpp)`` can be invoked as follows:

```Shell
$ cpp main.c                                                   # writes pre-processed output to STDOUT
$ cpp main.c > main.i                                          # redirect preprocessed output to <filename>.i
```

Pre-processed output is usually stored in an ``ASCII`` file with ``.i`` extension. 

> *The ``cpp`` accepts most gcc options such as ``-I``, ``-DNAME`` etc. for a more comphrehensive list refer ``man cpp``*

The pre-processor can also be invoked by passing the ``-E`` flag to ``gcc``:

```Shell
$ gcc -Wall -E helloWorld.c                                   # write preprocessed output to STDOUT
$ gcc -Wall -E helloWorld.c -o helloWorld.i                   # write preprocessed output to <filename.i>
```

A more compact output can be obtained by using the ``-P`` flag

```Shell
$ gcc -Wall -E -P helloWorld.c -o helloWorld.i
```

To illustrate the effect of conditional compilation due to a macro being defined or undefined:

```Shell
$ gcc -Wall -E helloWorld.h -o helloWorld.i                # macro DEBUG is not defined, so statements under #ifdef ignored
$ gcc -Wall -DDEBUG -E helloWrold.h -o helloWorld.i        # macro DEBUG is defined, so statements under #ifdef included
```

## 3. Compilation proper

The next step is the conversion of preprocessed source code to assembly code for a target processor or processor family. The preprocessed code is optimized by eliminating comments, white spaces, and extracting tokens from the text before lexical/syntactical analysis.

#### Lexical analysis
Lexical analysis or tokenization converts a sequence of characters in the C/C++ source code to a sequence of tokens (strings with an assigned and thus identified meaning). Tokens form the smallest indivisble units of a program.

#### Syntax analysis
Parsing or syntactical analysis ensures the tokens conform to the rules of C/C++ language.

#### Semantic analysis
Checks whether the statements formed by tokens make any sense at all, e.g. the result of adding two integers is an integer etc. 

#### Converting from C/C++ to assembly language
After the source code has been confirmed to have no syntax or semantic errors, the C/C++ constructs are converted to the instruction set of the target CPU. The commandline option ``-S`` instructs ``gcc`` to convert the preprocessed C source code to assembly language without creating an object file:

```Shell
$ gcc -Wall -S hello.i           # converts preprocessed output <filename>.i to assembly code <filename>.s
$ gcc -Wall -S main.i           
```

The resulting assembly language source file is stored as ``<filename>.s`` unless a file name is specifed explicitly. The generated assembly file is specific to the target CPU architecture and contains instructions in that language.

## 4. Assembly
The purpose of the assembler is to convert assembly language into machine code and generate an object file. When there are calls to external functions in the assembly source file, the assembler leaves the addresses of the external functions undefined, to be filled in later by the linker. The instruction mnemonics in the assembly language file are converted to binary opcodes, the object file is not human readable.

```Shell
$ as helloWorld.s -o helloWorld.o
$ as main.s -o main.o
```

Alternatively to perform all steps from pre-processing, compilation upto assembling use the ``-c`` flag:

```Shell
$ gcc -c helloWorld.c -o helloWorld.o
$ gcc -c main.c -o main.o
```

## 5. Linking
The final stage of compilation is the linking of object files to create an executable. The GNU Linker ``(ld)`` resolves references to external functions (defined in libraries, system functions, C/C++ Standard Libraries etc.) and creates the executable.

Instead of invoking the linker explicitly, we can let ``gcc`` handle everything for us:

```Shell
$ gcc -Wall main.o helloWorld.o -o helloWorld
```
