# 16. Compilation Process

The process of converting source code into an executable is a multi-stage process involving several tools, the complete set of tools used in the compilation process is referred to as a *toolchain*.  

It broadly consists of the following steps:

1. Code development using a text-editor - to write the code
2. Pre-processing using the GNU Preporcessor (``cpp``) - to expand macros
3. Compilation proper (lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis) using the language front end (i.e. ``gcc`` or ``g++``) to convert the source code from C/C++ to assembly language
4. Assembling - using GNU Assembler (``as``) to convert assembly code to object files (machine code)
5. Linking - using the GNU Linker (``ld``) to resolve references and create the final executable

> *All steps are executed automatically and transparently by GCC internally, so it is not necessary to carry them out individually.*
