# 16. Compilation Process

> *Compilation - process of translating source code from a higher level language to a lower level language.*

Deriving an executable from source code is a multi-step process broadly consisting of the following steps:

1. Code development using a text-editor
2. Pre-processing using the GNU Preporcessor (``cpp``) for macro expansion
3. Compilation proper (lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis) using the language front end (i.e. ``gcc`` or ``g++``) to convert source code from C/C++ to assembly
4. Assembling - using GNU Assembler (``as``) to convert assembly code to object files (machine code)
5. Linking - using the GNU Linker (``ld``) to resolve references and create the final executable

> *All steps are executed internally by GCC, so unless there is a specific need there is no need to run each step individually.*

Each of these steps will be illustrated using the following example code:

```helloWorld.h``` declares the function prototype for ```hello```.

```C
/**********************************************
helloWorld.h
***********************************************/

#ifndef HELLO_WORLD
#define HELLO_WORLD

void hello(const char *str);

#endif
```

```helloWorld.c``` defines the function ```hello```, which simply prints a string to the ```STDOUT```.

```C
/**********************************************
helloWorld.c
***********************************************/

#include <stdio.h>
#include "helloWorld.h"

void hello(const char *str)
{
    printf("%s",str);
}

```

```main.c``` includes ```helloWorld.h``` and calls the function ```hello```.

```C
/**********************************************
main.c
***********************************************/

#include "helloWorld.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    hello("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## 1. Code Development
The first natural step in any software development project is to *write* code using a text editor or a suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice. When using the GNU toolchain usually a build automation system such as GNU make is used. The organization of the code into multiple source files and it's architecture vastly influences the compilation pipeline. Not to mention that good programming practices and secure coding result in a binary which is faster, smaller and secure. 

## 2. Pre-processing
The pre-processor ``cpp`` operates on pre-processor directives and performs the following operations on source code:
* includes the contents of header files specified using ``#include`` directives in source files
* replaces constants and macros defined using ``#define`` with their values - it performs no type checking, replaces text as is
* exclude or include lines of code based on ``#if``, ``#elif``, ``#ifdef`` and ``#ifndef`` statements

The C pre-processor ``(cpp)`` can be invoked as follows:

```Shell
$ cpp helloWorld.c
$ cpp helloWorld.c > helloWorld.i
```

> *The ``cpp`` accepts most gcc options such as ``-I``, ``-DNAME`` etc. For a more comphrehensive list refer ``man cpp``*

The pre-processor can be invoked by passing the ``-E`` flag to ``gcc``, output is written only to the ``STDOUT``:

```Shell
$ gcc -Wall -E main.c helloWorld.c
```

Pre-processed output is usually stored in an ``ASCII`` file with ``.i`` extension. 

```Shell
$ gcc -Wall -E main.c helloWorld.c -o main.i helloWorld.i
```

A more compact pre-processed output can be generated by using the ``-P`` flag:

```Shell
$ gcc -Wall -E -P main.c helloWorld.c -o main.i helloWorld.i
```
