# 16. Compilation Process

> *Compilation - process of translating source code from a higher level language to a lower level language.*

Deriving an executable from source code is a multi-step process and broadly consists of the following steps:

1. Code development using a text-editor
2. Pre-processing using the GNU Preporcessor (``cpp``) for macro expansion
3. Compilation proper (lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis) using the language front end (i.e. ``gcc`` or ``g++``) to convert source code from C/C++ to assembly
4. Assembling - using GNU Assembler (``as``) to convert assembly code to object files (machine code)
5. Linking - using the GNU Linker (``ld``) to resolve references and create the final executable

> *All steps are executed internally by GCC, so unless there is a specific need there is no need to run each step individually.*

Each of these steps will be illustrated using the following example code:

```helloWorld.h``` declares the function prototype for ```hello```.

```C
/**********************************************
helloWorld.h
***********************************************/

#ifndef HELLO_WORLD
#define HELLO_WORLD

void hello(const char *str);

#endif
```

```helloWorld.c``` defines the function ```hello```, which simply prints a string to the ```STDOUT```.

```C
/**********************************************
helloWorld.c
***********************************************/

#include <stdio.h>
#include "helloWorld.h"

void hello(const char *str)
{
    printf("%s",str);
}

```

```main.c``` includes ```helloWorld.h``` and calls the function ```hello```.

```C
/**********************************************
main.c
***********************************************/

#include "helloWorld.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    hello("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## 1. Code Development
The first natural step in any software development project is to *write* code using a text editor or a suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice. If an IDE is being used, usually the compilation process resembles a push-button flow. When using the GNU toolchain we prefer to manage the compilation process using tools such as ``make``. The organization of the code (into multiple source files, dir structure etc.) it's architecture influences the compilation pipeline significantly. Not to mention that good programming practices and secure coding result in a fast, small and secure executable! 

## 2. Pre-processing
The pre-processor ``cpp`` operates on pre-processor directives and performs the following operations on source code:
* includes the contents of standard library and user defines header files as specified by ``#include`` directives
* replaces macro definitions specified by ``#define`` with their constant values
* exclude or include lines of code based on ``#if``, ``#elif``, ``#ifdef`` and ``#ifndef`` statements

The output of the pre-processor is an ASCII file with ``.i`` extension. To only invoke the pre-processor ``-E`` flag can be used:

#### Syntax analysis
#### Semantic analysis
## 4. Assembling
## 5. Linking
