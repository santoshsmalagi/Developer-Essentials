## 15. Common compiler flags
C

    Program for compiling C programs; default ‘cc’.
CXX

    Program for compiling C++ programs; default ‘g++’.
CPP

    Program for running the C preprocessor, with results to standard output; default ‘$(CC) -E’
    CFLAGS

    Extra flags to give to the C compiler.
CXXFLAGS

    Extra flags to give to the C++ compiler.
CPPFLAGS

    Extra flags to give to the C preprocessor and programs that use it (the C and Fortran compilers).
LDFLAGS

    Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker, ‘ld’, such as -L. Libraries (-lfoo) should be added to the LDLIBS variable instead.
LDLIBS

    Library flags or names given to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker, ‘ld’. LOADLIBES is a deprecated (but still supported) alternative to LDLIBS. Non-library linker flags, such as -L, should go in the LDFLAGS variable.
LFLAGS

    Extra flags to give to Lex.

The CFLAGS variable sets compile flags for gcc:
The LDFLAGS variable sets flags for linker
