## 1. The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)

GCC stands for “GNU Compiler Collection”. GCC is an integrated distribution of compilers for several major programming languages. These languages currently include C, C++,
Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, Ada, D, Go, and BRIG (HSAIL).  

The language-independent component of GCC includes the majority of the optimizers, as well as the *“back ends”* that generate machine code for various processors.  The part of a compiler that is specific to a particular language is called the *“front end”*. For example the C front-end is called CC, the C++ compiler is G++, the Ada compiler is GNAT, and so on.  

Historically, compilers for many languages, including C++ and Fortran, have been implemented as “preprocessors” which emit another high level language such as C. None of
the compilers included in GCC are implemented this way; they all generate machine code directly.
