# 1. The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is an optimizing compiler produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages, hardware architectures and operating systems. These languages currently include C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, Ada, D, Go, and BRIG (HSAIL). The Free Software Foundation (FSF) distributes GCC as free software under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). GCC is a key component of the GNU toolchain and the standard compiler for most projects related to GNU and the Linux kernel. With roughly 15 million lines of code in 2019, GCC is one of the biggest open source programs in existence. It has played an important role in the growth of free software, as both a tool and an example. 

The language-independent component of GCC includes the majority of the optimizers, as well as the *“back ends”* that generate machine code for various processors.  The part of a compiler that is specific to a particular language is called the *“front end”*. For example the C front-end is called *gcc* (*or cc*), the C++ compiler is *g++*, the Ada compiler is *gnat*, and so on. 

> *GCC is a collection of compiler front ends to a common back-end compilation engine.*
