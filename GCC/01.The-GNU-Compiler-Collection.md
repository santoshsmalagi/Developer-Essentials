# 1. The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is an optimizing compiler produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages, hardware architectures and operating systems. These languages currently include C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, Ada, D, Go, and BRIG (HSAIL). The Free Software Foundation (FSF) distributes GCC as free software under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). GCC is a key component of the GNU toolchain and the standard compiler for most projects related to GNU and the Linux kernel. With roughly 15 million lines of code in 2019, GCC is one of the biggest open source programs in existence. It has played an important role in the growth of free software, as both a tool and an example. 

The language-independent component of GCC includes the majority of the optimizers, as well as the *“back ends”* that generate machine code for various processors.  The part of a compiler that is specific to a particular language is called the *“front end”*. For example the C front-end is called *gcc* (*or cc*), the C++ compiler is *g++*, the Ada compiler is *gnat*, and so on. 

> *GCC is a collection of compiler front ends to a common back-end compilation engine.*

## History of GCC
The original author of the GNU C Compiler (GCC) is Richard Stallman, the founder of the GNU Project. In late 1983 Stallman approached Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the author of the Amsterdam Compiler Kit (also known as the Free University Compiler Kit) for permission to use that software for GNU. When Tanenbaum advised him that "*the compiler was not free, and that only the university was free*", Stallman decided to work on a different compiler. Stallman wrote a new C front end for the Livermore compiler, but then realized that it required megabytes of stack space, an impossibility on a 68000 Unix system with only 64 KB, and concluded he would have to write a new compiler from scratch.  

The first release of GCC was made in March 22, 1987. This was a significant breakthrough, being the first portable ANSI C optimizing compiler released as free software. A major revision of the compiler came with the 2.0 series in 1992, which added the ability to compile C++. In 1997 an experimental branch of the compiler (EGCS) was created, to improve optimization and C++ support. Following this work, EGCS was adopted as the new main-line of GCC development, and these features became widely available in the 3.0 release of GCC in 2001.  

Since then the devlopment of GCC as one of the flagship projects of GNU has continued under the direction of the FSF. Major decisions about GCC are made by the steering committee, guided by the mission statement. A worldwide community of developers maintain the project adding support for new languages, architectures, and features, while providing patches and bug fixes.  

As of June 2021, the recent 11.1 release of GCC includes front ends for C (gcc), C++ (g++), Objective-C, Fortran (gfortran), Ada (GNAT), Go (gccgo) and D (GDC, since 9.1) programming languages, with the OpenMP and OpenACC parallel language extensions being supported since GCC 5.1. Versions prior to GCC 7 also supported Java (gcj), allowing compilation of Java to native machine code.

## Major features of GCC

GCC is a portable compiler—it runs on most platforms available today, and can produce output for many types of processors. In addition to the processors used in personal computers, it also supports microcontrollers, DSPs and 64-bit CPUs.

GCC is the standard compiler shipped in every major and most minor Linux distributions. Virtually all other open software is based on it at some level or another. Even other languages, such as Perl and Python, are written in C, which is compiled by the GNU compiler.

GCC is not only a native compiler—it can also cross-compile any program, producing executable files for a different system from the one used by GCC itself.

GCC is written in C with a strong focus on portability, and can compile itself, so it can be adapted to new systems easily.

GCC has multiple language frontends, for parsing different languages. GCC has a modular design, allowing support for new languages and architectures to be added. Adding a new language front-end to GCC enables the use of that language on any architecture, provided that the necessary run-time facilities (such as libraries) are available. Similarly, adding support for a new architecture makes it available to all languages.

The academic computing community represents another large part of GCC’s user base.

Finally, and most importantly, GCC is free software, distributed under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).

software movement than any other.*
