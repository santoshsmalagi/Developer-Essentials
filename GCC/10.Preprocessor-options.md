# 10. Preprocessor options

The ``-E`` option controls the C pre-processor, which is run on every C source file before actual compilation. If the ``-E`` option is specified then nothing is done except pre-processing. For example:

``$ gcc -E helloWorld.c main.c``

Replaces all macro definitions with their defined values.

## Defining macros during compilation 

There are multiple ways to defined macros during compilation:

``-Dname`` - defines a macro with definition of 1  
``-D name`` - same as above  
``-Dname=val`` - defines a macro with specified constant value  
``-D name=val`` - same as above  
``--define-macro name=val`` - using the ``define-macro`` command to define a macro

Example:

```Shell
$ gcc -Wall -DDEBUG helloWorld.c main.c -o helloWorld
$ gcc -Wall -E -DDEBUG=1 helloWorld.c main.c
```

The contents of such definitions are tokenized and processed as if they appeared in a ``#define`` directive. Usually such macro definitions are passed on to the ``CFLAGS`` variable:  

```Shell
CFLAGS += -DDEBUG
```

> *Defining macros during compilation is very useful, especially for conditional compilation where certain blocks of code need to be included or excluded. See [Conditional Debugging](../Conditional-Debug-Code.md) for more details.*
