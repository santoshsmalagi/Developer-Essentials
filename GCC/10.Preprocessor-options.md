# 10. Preprocessor options

These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source file before actual compilation. If you use the ``-E`` option, nothing is done except preprocessing. For example:

``$ gcc -E helloWorld.c main.c``

## Defining macros during compilation 

-D name Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.
-D name=definition
The contents of definition are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during
translation phase three in a ‘#define’ directive.
