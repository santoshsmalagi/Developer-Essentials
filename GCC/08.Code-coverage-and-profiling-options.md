# 8. Code coverage and profiling options

The purpose of instrumentation is to collect profiling statistics for use in finding program hot spots, code coverage analysis, or profile-guided optimizations using a tool such as ``gprof``. To compile a program with profiling enabled use the following flags:

* ``-p``
  * generates profiling information for use by the ``prof``tool
* ``-pg``
  * generate profiling information for use by the ``gprof`` tool

> *Use the ``-pg`` or ``=p`` option during both compilation as well as linking (or both).

Example: 

```Shell
$ gcc -g -c myprog.c utils.c -pg
$ gcc -o myprog myprog.o utils.o -pg
$ gcc -o myprog myprog.c utils.c -g -pg
```
