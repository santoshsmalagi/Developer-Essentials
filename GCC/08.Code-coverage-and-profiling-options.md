# 8. Code coverage and profiling options

The purpose of instrumentation is to collect profiling statistics for use in finding program hot spots, code coverage analysis, or profile-guided optimizations using a tool such as ``gprof``. To compile a program with profiling enabled use the following flags:

* ``-p``
  * generates profiling information for use by the ``prof``tool
* ``-pg``
  * generate profiling information for use by the ``gprof`` tool

> *Use the ``-pg`` or ``=p`` option during both compilation as well as linking (or both).*

Example: 

```Shell
$ gcc -g -c myprog.c utils.c -pg
$ gcc -o myprog myprog.o utils.o -pg
$ gcc -o myprog myprog.c utils.c -g -pg
```

If you compile only some of the modules of the program with ``-pg``, you can still profile the program, but you won't get complete information about the modules that were compiled without ``-pg``. The only information you get for the functions in those modules is the total time spent in them; there is no record of how many times they were called, or from where. This will not affect the flat profile (except that the calls field for the functions will be blank), but will greatly reduce the usefulness of the call graph.  

To perform line-by-line profiling, you will also need to specify the ``-g`` option, instructing the compiler to insert debugging symbols into the program that match program addresses to source code lines.  

In addition to the ``-pg`` and ``-g`` options, you may also wish to specify the ``-a`` option when compiling. This will instrument the program to perform basic-block counting. As the program runs, it will count how many times it executed each branch of each ``if`` statement, each iteration of each ``do`` loop, etc. This will enable gprof to construct an annotated source code listing showing how many times each line of code was executed.
