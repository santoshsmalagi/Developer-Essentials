## 5. Options for warning messages

Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there may have been an error.

* ``-w`` - Inhibit all warning messages.
* ``-Werror`` - Make all warnings into errors.
* ``-Werror=`` - Make the specified warning into an error. The specifier for a warning is appended; for example ``-Werror=switch`` turns the warnings controlled by ``-Wswitch`` into errors.
* ``-Wall`` - This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros. This also enables some language-specific warnings.
* ``-Wextra`` - This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by ``-Wall``. The option ``-Wextra`` also prints warning messages for the following cases:
    * a pointer is compared against integer zero with ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, or ``>=``.
    * (C++ only) An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a conditional expression.
    * (C++ only) Ambiguous virtual bases.
    * (C++ only) Subscripting an array that has been declared register.
    * (C++ only) Taking the address of a variable that has been declared register.
    * (C++ only) A base class is not initialized in the copy constructor of a derived class.
