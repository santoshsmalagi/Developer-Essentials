## Examining object files and binaries
This section describes several useful tools for examining the contents of object files and binaries. The following table summarizes the various tools and their intended purpose:

| Utilities                              | Purpose                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ``strace`` (Linux command line utility)    | print a list of low-level (kernel) system calls made when the  binary is executed      |
| ``ltrace`` (Linux command line utility)    | print a list of calls made to the library functions when the binary is executed        |
| ``file``  (Linux command line utility)     | to find the most basic details about the generated binary                              |
| ``size`` (part of GNU Binutils)            | list the sizes of various sections (i.e. text, data, bss) within a binary              |
| ``nm`` (part of GNU Binutils)              | primarily to examine the symbol table and check whether a function/variable is defined |
| ``ldd`` (Linux utility, actually a script) | examine the shared lib dependencies                                                    |
| ``objdump`` (part of GNU Binutils)         | display information about object files                                                 |
| ``readelf`` (part of GNU Binutils)         | display information about an ELF file                                                  |
| ``strip`` (part of GNU Binutils)           | discards symbols               |
| ``addr2line`` (Linux command line utility)   | trace the line number in src code using a debug build                                  |
| ``gdb`` (Linux utility)                                    | The classic C/C++ source level debugger on Linux systems                               |
