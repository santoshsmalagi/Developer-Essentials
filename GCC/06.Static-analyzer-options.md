# 6. Static analyzer options

Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs, in contrast with dynamic analysis, which is analysis performed on programs while they are executing.
This GCC static analysis framework can easily report use after free errors, double frees, and other common C coding issues that are detectable via static analysis. The implementation is quite interesting and opens the doors for GCC a lot but in using this --analyzer pass roughly doubles the compile times.

-fanalyzer
This option enables an static analysis of program flow which looks for “interesting”
interprocedural paths through the code, and issues warnings for problems
found on them.
This analysis is much more expensive than other GCC warnings.
Enabling this option effectively enables the following warnings:
-Wanalyzer-double-fclose     --- > This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a FILE * can have
fclose called on it more than once.
-Wanalyzer-double-free This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a pointer can have a
deallocator called on it more than once, either free, or a deallocator referenced
by attribute malloc.
-Wanalyzer-exposure-through-output-file
-Wanalyzer-file-leak
-Wanalyzer-free-of-non-heap
-Wanalyzer-malloc-leak
-Wanalyzer-mismatching-deallocation
-Wanalyzer-possible-null-argument
-Wanalyzer-possible-null-dereference
-Wanalyzer-null-argument
-Wanalyzer-null-dereference
138 Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
-Wanalyzer-shift-count-negative
-Wanalyzer-shift-count-overflow
-Wanalyzer-stale-setjmp-buffer
-Wanalyzer-tainted-array-index
-Wanalyzer-unsafe-call-within-signal-handler
-Wanalyzer-use-after-free
-Wanalyzer-use-of-pointer-in-stale-stack-frame
-Wanalyzer-write-to-const
-Wanalyzer-write-to-string-literal
This option is only available if GCC was configured with analyzer support
enabled

** Use -Wno to disable **
-Wno-analyzer-double-fclose
This warning requires ‘-fanalyzer’, which enables it; use
‘-Wno-analyzer-double-fclose’ to disable it.
This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a FILE * can have
fclose called on it more than once.
-Wno-analyzer-double-free
This warning requires ‘-fanalyzer’, which enables it; use
‘-Wno-analyzer-double-free’ to disable it.
This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a pointer can have a
deallocator called on it more than once, either free, or a deallocator referenced
by attribute malloc.

### Explain most widely used ones

-Wanalyzer-double-fclose     --- > This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a FILE * can have
fclose called on it more than once.
-Wanalyzer-double-free This diagnostic warns for paths through the code in which a pointer can have a
deallocator called on it more than once, either free, or a deallocator referenced
