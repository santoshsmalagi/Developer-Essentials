# 6. Static analyzer options

Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs, in contrast with dynamic analysis, which is analysis performed on programs while they are executing.
This GCC static analysis framework can easily report use after free errors, double frees, and other common C coding issues that are detectable via static analysis. The implementation is quite interesting and opens the doors for GCC a lot but in using this --analyzer pass roughly doubles the compile times.
