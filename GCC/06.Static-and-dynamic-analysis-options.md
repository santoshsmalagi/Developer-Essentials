# 6. Static and dynamic analysis options

*Static analysis* examines a program's source code to identify potential problems without actually executing it. GCC's static analysis engine can identify problems such as null pointer deferences, double frees, memory leaks, integer overflow, divide by zero error, out of bounds array access etc.  

*Dynamic or runtime analysis* evaluates and tests a program during its execution. GCC enables code intrumentation during compilation to allow for runtime analysis using one of several *sanitizers* such as *AddressSanitizer (ASan), LeakSanitizer (LSan), ThreadSanitizer (TSan), UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSsan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan).* The sanitizers are open source tools developed by Google which are integrated into GCC starting version 4.8, since they depend on compiler instrumentation, so one needs to rebuild the program with appropriate flags to enable runtime analysis.

> *Static and dynamic analysis approaches are complementary, because no single approach can find every error. For comphrehensive code quality tests both static and dynamic analysis are performed.*

Use of static/dynamic analysis capabilites increases the compilation/runtime of programs, in most cases this is worth the trade-off.

## Static analysis using GCC

Having a static analysis engine built inside the compiler offers several advantages:

* Static analysis is performed at compile time rather than at run time
* Eliminates the (possible) need for an external or proprietary static analysis tool
* Ensures that the static analysis engine sees *the exact same code* as the compiler thereby avoiding checks on different code bases
* External static analyzers dont see the macro definitions, and hence can sometimes raise false positives

> *Other well known static analysis tools incldue - CppCheck(free), SonarQube(LGPL) and Parasoft C/C++ Test (proprietary)*

To enable GCC's static analysis capabilities use the ```-fanalyzer``` command option. Enabling this option effectively enables the following warnings:

#### Use ``-Wno-<rule>`` to disable a warning
To disable any particular rule use ``-Wno-<rule>`` for example - ``-Wno-analyzer-double-fclose`` disables the check for double close of ``FILE*``.


## Dynamic analysis using GCC

Sanitizers are open source dynamic code analysis tools designed by Google and integrated within GCC:

* AddressSanitizer (ASan)
* LeakSanitizer (LSan)
* ThreadSanitizer (TSan)
* UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSsan)
* MemorySanitizer (MSan)

Sanitizers depend on compiler instrumentation, so one needs to rebuild the program with appropriate flags to enable runtime analysis with these tools. In general:

```Shell
$ gcc -Wall -g -fsanitize=[sanitizer] [additional flags]
```

Where ``sanitizer`` could be one of:

* ``address`` for AddressSanitizer
* ``leak`` for LeakSanitizer
* ``thread`` for ThreadSanitizer
* ``undefined`` for UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
* ``memory`` for MemorySanitizer

``[additional_flags]`` could be other compilation flags, such as ``-fno-omit-frame-pointer``, ``fsanitize-recover/fno-sanitize-recover``, ``-fsanitize-blacklist`` etc. It is recommended to use ``-g`` flag to include line numbers and file names in warning messages, which also provides the ability to locate the source of a problem after an application has been run.

### AddressSanitizer (ASan) options

AddressSanitizer (aka ASan) is a memory error detector for C/C++. It detects the following errors:
* NULL pointer dereference
* Use after free (dangling pointer dereference)
* Heap buffer overflow
* Stack buffer overflow
* Global buffer overflow
* Use after return
* Use after scope
* Initialization order bugs
* Memory leaks 

ASan maintains a map of bits for the memory to determine if the memory location being accessed by a pointer is valid or invalid. To detect ‘out of bound’ access memory blocks have a ‘red zone’ at the beginning and the end’ of the usable memory. If an invalid memory access happens, then this is indicated and written out to the log.

Use of ASan is illustrated using the following examples:

```C
/****************************************
main.c - NULL pointer dereferencing
*****************************************/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  char *cptr = NULL;
  printf("%c",*cptr);
  return 0;
}
```

To compile and run:

```Shell
$ gcc -Wall -g -fsanitize=address main.c -o main
$ ./main
```

ASan reports the following ERROR in the log:

```Shell

**ASan and gdb**  
It is possible to use ``gdb`` with binaries built using AddressSanitizer in a usual way. When AddressSanitizer finds a bug it calls one of the functions ``__asan_report_{load,store}{1,2,4,8,16}`` which in turn calls ``__asan::ReportGenericError``. If you want gdb to stop before ASan reports an error, set a breakpoint on ``__asan::ReportGenericError``. If you want gdb to stop after ASan has reported an error, set a breakpoint on ``__sanitizer::Die`` or use ``ASAN_OPTIONS=abort_on_error=1``.

Inside gdb you can ask asan to describe a memory location:

``Shell
(gdb) set overload-resolution off
(gdb) p __asan_describe_address(0x7ffff73c3f80)
0x7ffff73c3f80 is located 0 bytes inside of 10-byte region [0x7ffff73c3f80,0x7ffff73c3f8a)
freed by thread T0 here: 
``
