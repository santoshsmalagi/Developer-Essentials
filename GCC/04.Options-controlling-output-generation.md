## 4. Options controlling output generation (Overall options)

Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation proper, assembly and linking, always in that order. The “overall options” allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage. 

#### -c Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link. 

The ultimate output is in the form of an object file for each source file. By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix ‘.c’, ‘.i’, ‘.s’, etc., with ‘.o’. Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are ignored.

#### -S Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble. 
The output is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input file specified. By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by replacing the
suffix ‘.c’, ‘.i’, etc., with ‘.s’. Input files that don’t require compilation are ignored.

#### -E Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper. 

The output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the standard output. Input files that don’t require preprocessing are ignored.

#### -o file Place the primary output in file file. 
This applies to whatever sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file, an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code. If ‘-o’ is not specified, the default is to put an executable file in ‘a.out’, the object file for ‘source.suffix’ in ‘source.o’, its assembler file in ‘source.s’, a
precompiled header file in ‘source.suffix.gch’, and all preprocessed C source on standard output.

#### -std= Determine the language standard

#### Directory search path (-I)

These options specify directories to search for header files, for libraries and for parts of the compiler:

-I dir
-iquote dir
-isystem dir
-idirafter dir

Add the directory dir to the list of directories to be searched for header files during preprocessing. If dir begins with ‘=’ or $SYSROOT, then the ‘=’ or $SYSROOT
is replaced by the sysroot prefix; see ‘--sysroot’ and ‘-isysroot
