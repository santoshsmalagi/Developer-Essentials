## 4. Options controlling output generation (Overall options)

The “overall options” allow us to stop the compilation process at an intermediate stage - preprocessing, compilation proper, assembly or linking.

## Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link ``(-c)``

The ultimate output is in the form of an object file for each source file. By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix ‘.c’, ‘.i’, ‘.s’, etc., with ‘.o’. Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are ignored.

```$ gcc -Wall -c helloWorld.c main.c```

## Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble ``(-S)`` 
The output is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input file specified. By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by replacing the
suffix ``.c``, ``.i``, etc. with ``.s``. Input files that don’t require compilation are ignored.

```$ gcc -Wall -S helloWorld.c main.c```

## Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper ``(-E)`` 
The output is in the form of pre-processed source code, which is sent to the standard output. Input files that don’t require pre-processing are ignored.

```$ gcc -Wall -E helloWorld.c main.c```

## Place the primary output in the specified output file ``(-o)``
This applies to whatever sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file, an object file, an assembler file, or preprocessed C/C++ code. If ``-o`` is not specified, the default is to put an executable file in an ``a.out``, the object file for ``<source>.suffix`` in ``<source>.o``, its assembler file in ``<source>.s``, a
precompiled header file in ``<source>.<suffix>.gch``, and all preprocessed C/C++ source on standard output.

## Directory search path ``(-I)``
These options specify the list of directories to be searched for header files and library files during compilation:

``-I <dir>``  
``-iquote <dir>``  
``-isystem <dir>``  
``-idirafter <dir>``  

If dir begins with ``=`` or ``$SYSROOT``, then the ``=`` or ``$SYSROOT`` is replaced by the sysroot prefix.
