## 11. Preprocessor options

These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source file before actual
compilation. If you use the ‘-E’ option, nothing is done except preprocessing. Some of these options
make sense only together with ‘-E’ because they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable
for actual compilation.

-D name Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.
-D name=definition
The contents of definition are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during
translation phase three in a ‘#define’ directive.
